    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //200 100
    // The value of age is stored in age2 once. Despite age being updated later, age2 is still the original value.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team); // [3] will be Lux in both
    // This is because team is merely a reference to the original array. So when you target 'team'
    // you are actually targeting the original players array.

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let team2 = players.splice(); // returns new version of og array
    let team3 = [].concat(players); // same end result
    let team4 = [...players] // es6 fancy way

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Nick',
      age: 77
    }
    // with Objects
    const captain = person;
    console.log(person, captain); //both are aged 99 now

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = {...person}; // es6 spread
    const cap3 = Object.assign( {}, person, { name: 'torb' }) //object assign
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const nick = {
      name: "Nick",

      social: {
        facebook: "fbURL",
        insta: "instaURL"
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(nick);

    const nick2 = Object.assign({}, nick) //the .social of nick2 would still be a ref to the .social of nick
    const nick3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nick)); //turns entire obj to string, immediately parses back to obj, losing all refs
